1.0.2 (October 6, 2017)
=======================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Calling `getUserMedia` in browsers which do not support `getUserMedia` (such
  as iOS 8) would hang indefinitely. Now we reject with an error.

1.0.1 (September 12, 2017)
==========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `RTCSessionDescription` properties are now read-only, and therefore standards-compliant. (JSDK-1503)  

1.0.0 (August 17, 2017)
=======================

- Factored out the WebRTC shims from twilio-video.js 1.2.0 into its own library.
