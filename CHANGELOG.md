1.1.0 (in progress)
===================

New Features
------------

- Adds Chrome support for getting and setting `maxPacketLifeTime` on
  RTCDataChannels by remapping the legacy property `maxRetransmitTime` to
  `maxPacketLifeTime`. (JSDK-1572)

1.0.3 (October 13, 2017)
========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug where we created too many MediaStreams in Firefox (one per call to
  `getLocalStreams` and `getRemoteStreams`). (JSDK-1558)

1.0.2 (October 6, 2017)
=======================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Calling `getUserMedia` in browsers which do not support `getUserMedia` (such
  as iOS 8) would hang indefinitely. Now we reject with an error.

1.0.1 (September 12, 2017)
==========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- `RTCSessionDescription` properties are now read-only, and therefore standards-compliant. (JSDK-1503)  

1.0.0 (August 17, 2017)
=======================

- Factored out the WebRTC shims from twilio-video.js 1.2.0 into its own library.
